When working with google products whether that be Sheets, Docs, or anything else, Google Apps Script provides an easy way to manipulate and automate Google Services. Given the complexity of implementing encryption algorithms into code, for many the solution can be found in outside libraries. Due to the way Google Apps Script is designed, importing external code into your project can be needlessly complex. In this post I will cover a few of the methods you can use to intergrate the Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library (SJCL) into your Google Apps Script Project.

### Import Code Using UrlFetchApp and eval()

### Storing Outside Code Locally

### Conclusions
